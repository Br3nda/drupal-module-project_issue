This module allows teams to track outstanding items which need
resolution. It provides e-mail notifications to members about updates
to items.  Similar to many issue tracking systems.

Send feature requests and bug reports to the issue tracking system for
the project module: http://drupal.org/node/add/project_issue/project_issue.

The project module is currently being maintained by:
Derek Wright <drupal-project@dwwright.net> 
"dww" on drupal.org (http://drupal.org/user/46549).


Wish list
--------

 - Using the existing Drupal "comment" system for issue replies
   instead of the customized issue "follow-ups" currently in place.
 - Better mailhandler integration for creating and replying to issues
   via email.
 - Add method for project owner to assign issues to others.
 - Add a setting where you can select what node type should be the
   "project" that project_issues are associated with.
 - RSS feeds for issues
 - Improve themeability of listings and issues.
 - Allow projects to specify their own categories (bug report, feature
   request, etc).
 - Tool for administrators to be able to update the status of several
   issues at once (mass closing).
 - Make components sub-projects with their own defaults.
 - Enable taxonomy support.
